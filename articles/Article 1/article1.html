                <h2>What is Git?</h2>
                <p>Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects simultaneously, managing their revisions efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Key Concepts of Git:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Repository:</strong> A repository, or repo, is a collection of files and directories associated with a project, along with the version history of each file.</li>
                    <li><strong>Commit:</strong> A commit is a snapshot of changes made to files in the repository at a specific time. Each commit has a unique identifier.</li>
                    <li><strong>Branch:</strong> A branch is a parallel version of the repository. It allows developers to work on features or fixes independently without affecting the main codebase until they are ready to merge their changes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pull Request:</strong> A pull request is a proposed change to the repository submitted by a developer. It allows others to review the changes before they are merged into the main codebase.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
                <p>GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform for collaboration, allowing developers to share and contribute to open-source projects. GitHub offers features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project management tools.</p>

                <h2>Key Features of GitHub:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Repository Hosting:</strong> GitHub hosts Git repositories in the cloud, making it easy to access and manage projects from anywhere.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> GitHub facilitates collaboration among developers by providing tools for code review, issue tracking, and project management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community:</strong> GitHub has a large community of developers contributing to open-source projects, making it a valuable resource for learning and sharing knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration:</strong> GitHub integrates with various development tools and services, such as continuous integration (CI) platforms and deployment pipelines, to streamline the development workflow.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Git and GitHub are essential tools for modern software development, enabling efficient collaboration, version control, and project management. By understanding these tools and incorporating them into your workflow, you can enhance productivity and streamline the development process.</p>
